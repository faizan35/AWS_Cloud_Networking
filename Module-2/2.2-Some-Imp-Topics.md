# 2.2 Some Imp Topics in VPC

## **VPC Best Practices:**

#### a. **Proper CIDR Block Planning:**

- Plan your CIDR blocks carefully to allow for future growth and to avoid IP address conflicts.

#### b. **Use of Subnets:**

- Utilize different subnets for different purposes (e.g., public and private subnets) to enhance security and manageability.

#### c. **Security Group Best Practices:**

- Follow security group best practices, such as using separate security groups for different functions and minimizing open ports.

#### d. **NAT Gateway vs. NAT Instances:**

- Prefer using NAT Gateways over NAT instances for simplicity, scalability, and availability.

#### e. **Regular Monitoring:**

- Regularly monitor VPC resources, including utilizing VPC Flow Logs, to identify and address potential issues.

## IaaS in VPC

Iaas are the services.

### **Use Case: Deploying a Web Application with IaaS in VPC:**

- **Scenario:**

  - Consider deploying a scalable web application that requires virtualized infrastructure.

- **IaaS Components in VPC:**

  1.  **EC2 Instances:** Launch multiple EC2 instances to host different components of the web application.
  2.  **EBS Volumes:** Attach EBS volumes to store data persistently.
  3.  **Load Balancer:** Utilize Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic among EC2 instances.
  4.  **VPC Networking:** Configure subnets, route tables, security groups, and network ACLs to create a secure and customized network environment.

- **Benefits:**

  - IaaS in VPC offers flexibility, control, and scalability for deploying the web application. You have the ability to tailor the infrastructure components based on the application's needs.

- **Scalability:**

  - IaaS resources in VPC can be easily scaled to accommodate changes in traffic. For instance, you can add more EC2 instances during peak usage and scale down during low demand.
