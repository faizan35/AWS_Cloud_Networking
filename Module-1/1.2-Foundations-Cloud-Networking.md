# 1.2 Foundations of Cloud Networking:

#### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) basics:

1.  **Overview:**

    - **Definition:** ELB automatically **distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets**, such as EC2 instances.

    - **Purpose:** Enhance fault tolerance, improve availability, and ensure even distribution of traffic.

2.  **Types of Load Balancers:**

    - **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** Operates at the application layer (Layer 7) and is ideal for HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Supports content-based routing.

    - **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** Operates at the transport layer (Layer 4) and is suitable for TCP/UDP traffic. Offers high performance and low latency.

3.  **Key Features:**

    - **Auto Scaling Integration:** ELB works seamlessly with Auto Scaling groups to adjust capacity based on traffic.
    - **Health Checks:** Regularly checks the health of registered instances and directs traffic only to healthy instances.

#### Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) fundamentals:

1.  **Definition:**

    - **VPC:** A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources.
    - **Purpose:** Allows you to define your IP address range, create subnets, configure route tables, and control network access.

2.  **Components of VPC:**

    - **Subnets:** Divisions of IP address ranges within a VPC. Instances in a subnet can communicate with each other.
    - **Route Tables:** Define rules for traffic within the VPC and to external networks.
    - **Security Groups:** Act as virtual firewalls for your instances, controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

3.  **VPC Peering:**

    - **Definition:** Connecting two VPCs to enable communication between instances in different VPCs.
    - **Use Cases:** Sharing resources, data, or services between VPCs.

#### Introduction to IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS:

1.  **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service):**

    - IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. **Dont worry about the physical hardware componets.**
    - Instead of managing physical hardware, users can rent virtual machines, storage, and networking components.
    - **Example:** EC2 instances, S3 storage.
    - **Use Case:** Gives you full control over the infrastructure, allowing you to manage and configure the environment.

2.  **PaaS (Platform as a Service):**

    - PaaS offers a platform for developing, running, and managing applications without dealing with the complexity of underlying infrastructure.
    - It abstracts away the infrastructure layer (IaaS) from the user. **Dont worry about the infrastructure**, focus only on to build, deploy, and manage applications entirely in the cloud.
    - **Example:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
    - **Use Case:** Streamlines application deployment, allowing developers to focus on writing code.

3.  **SaaS (Software as a Service):**

    - SaaS delivers software applications over the internet, eliminating the need for users to install, maintain, and manage the software locally.
    - Users access the software through a web browser.
    - SaaS abstracts both PaaS and IaaS layers from the end-user.
    - **Example:** AWS SaaS offerings like Amazon WorkMail.
    - **Use Case:** Users access applications without worrying about maintenance or management.
