# 1.1 Introduction to AWS

## Overview of AWS services:

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a vast array of cloud services to meet different computing needs.

**Some key AWS services include:**

1.  **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**

    - Provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
    - Enables you to run virtual servers known as **instances**.
    - Suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple web servers to complex machine learning models.

2.  **Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service):**

    - **Object storage service** that allows you to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time.
    - Scalable and designed for durability.
    - Used for storing and retrieving any amount of data, such as website images, backup files, and application data.

3.  **Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service):**

    - Managed **relational database** service.
    - Supports various database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server.
    - Handles routine database tasks such as patching, backups, and scaling.

4.  **AWS Lambda:**

    - **Serverless compute service**.
    - Runs code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers.
    - Ideal for event-driven applications and **microservices architecture**.

5.  **Amazon CloudFront:**

    - Content Delivery Network (CDN) service.
    - Distributes content globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.
    - Enhances the performance of websites and applications by caching and delivering content from edge locations.

## AWS Global Infrastructure:

AWS operates in a global infrastructure designed for high availability and fault tolerance. Key concepts include:

1.  **Regions:**

    - Think of AWS Regions as multiple bases/branches around the world.
    - Each region is unique (e.g., North Virginia, Ireland) and operates independently, and has multiple **Availability Zones**.
    - **Analogy**: multiple groups(regions) in your WhatsApp(world).

2.  **Availability Zones (AZs):**

    - Within each region, there are multiple data centers called availability zones.
    - They act as backup for each other, If one fails, the others take over to keep things running.
    - **Analogy**: In is like the members(AZs) in one of the multiple groups(regions).

3.  **Edge Locations:**

    - AWS has mini data centers at various places.
    - Global points in AWS Content Delivery Network (CloudFront) for caching and delivering content closer to end-users.

4.  **Local Zones:**

    - Mini AWS regions near specific cities for low-latency compute and storage.
    - They bring AWS services closer to those cities, making things faster for users in those areas.

5.  **Wavelength Zones:**

    - Any Zones that are close to 5G networks.
    - It takes advantage of 5G spped for things like gaming or streaming.

6.  **Global Accelerator and CloudFront:**

    - AWS provides tools like Global Accelerator and CloudFront.
    - These are like the express lanes on the internet.
    - They make sure your data travels super fast to users globally, improving performance.

#### **Scenario: Launching a Global Gaming App with AWS**

The gaming company launches a multiplayer game worldwide:

1.  **Regions & Availability Zones:**

    - Chooses AWS regions (e.g., us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-southeast-2) and deploys game servers across multiple availability zones for high availability.

2.  **Edge Locations & CloudFront:**

    - Uses AWS CloudFront with edge locations (e.g., Frankfurt) for low-latency content delivery to players globally.

3.  **Global Accelerator:**

    - Implements AWS Global Accelerator to optimize traffic flow, directing players to the closest game servers.

4.  **Local Zones & Wavelength:**

    - Deploys game servers in AWS Local Zones (e.g., Los Angeles) for ultra-low latency. Utilizes AWS Wavelength for 5G network edge capabilities.

5.  **GovCloud Regions:**

    - Ensures regulatory compliance by using AWS GovCloud (US) regions for special gaming events with government agencies.

6.  **Optimizing Data Transfer:**

    - Analyzes player distribution and strategically deploys additional game servers in regions like Asia-Pacific to reduce data transfer costs and enhance gameplay.

In this streamlined approach, AWS Global Infrastructure empowers the gaming company to deliver a scalable, resilient, and high-performance global gaming experience.
